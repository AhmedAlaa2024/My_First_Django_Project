# My_First_Django_Project: Blog (Zagel)
This is my first django project, I learnt django during working on this project. It is a blog divided into several boards. Every board divided into several topics. and each topic have several posts. If you have an account on the blog you can create new topic, new post and even reply on posts. The user who add the post who only can edit his post or his reply. and every client can create an account and update his profile, even change his password. I gave the blog name (Zagel) but it's a temporaty name.
